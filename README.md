# Menu-based-Simulation-for-CPU-Scheduling-Algorithms
<b>Operating System CSE 325 Fall 2022 Project</b> <br>

## Features

- Simulates 7 different CPU scheduling algorithms:
  - First Come First Serve (FCFS)
  - Shortest Job First (SJF) – Preemptive and Non-preemptive
  - Round Robin – Preemptive and Non-preemptive
  - Priority Scheduling – Preemptive and Non-preemptive
- Supports custom input for:
  - Number of processes
  - Burst time and Arrival time
  - Time quantum for Round Robin
  - Priority values
- Automatically compares **average waiting time** across all algorithms
- Highlights the **best** and **worst** performers
